## Introduction
[![Celestial Outbreak][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/iyyel/celestial-outbreak)

**Celestial Outbreak** is a space-themed 2D video game similar to Breakout, developed in Java.
It offers the classic Breakout gameplay with a colorful interface and some additional features.
The game is designed for customization, allowing players to create their own levels by adjusting
properties like the dimensions, size, speed, and color of the blocks, paddle, ball, and power-ups.

The aim of this project was to develop a simple 2D game with minimal use of third-party libraries. 
uses only the Graphics2D library for drawing shapes on the screen. The game's flow is managed by a
finite-state machine, simplifying the process of determining which screen to display and which audio
track to play.
